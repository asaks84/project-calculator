## Welcome to My Calculator Project

  

I'll try to create a simple calculator with some functions specified in the project scope.

  

- add

- subtract

- multiply

- divide

____

  

#### HTML

  

I think to use specific sintaxes tags, but I'll use this to practice more about CSS Grid to organize the calculator elements. The first step is to draw hand-free this on a paper.

  
  

#### JS

  

We need to use Objects. Specially last lesson was about it.

In the future, I will set the keyboards shortcuts.

## Result
