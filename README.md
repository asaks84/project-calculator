## Welcome to My Calculator Project

I'll try to create a simple calculator with some functions specified in the project scope.

- add
- subtract
- multiply
- divide

____

### HTML

I think to use specific sintaxes tags, but I'll use this to practice more about CSS Grid to organize the calculator elements. The first step is to draw hand-free this on a paper. 


### JS

II think to create 2 files to test how I can do it. One for the math functions and other to DOM. But it's kinda problematic . Maybe next time. We'll see on the final result.

And I think we need to use Objects. Specially last lesson was about it.


## Result

That's the link to live preview.
